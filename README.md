## Enumeration and Data Collection

We are using a Google Sheet with multiple tabs to track the available services, access controls, capabilities provided, tor compatibility, information needed for topology discovery, and related work.


## Current Stages

1. Enumeration
2. Terms-of-Service Analysis
3. Access Process
4. Capability Exploration
  - General capabilities
  - Tor Compatibility
  - Topology information collection
5. Topology Discovery (with collected IPs, IP ranges, ASNs, etc.)

**Somewhere in here e-mailing services about information such as bandwidth capacity and limits to services, as well as experiments.**
